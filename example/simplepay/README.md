# Simplepay

Example of checkout page using Midtrans Snap. A quick and secure way to accept
payment with a beautiful user interface done for you.

This is a very simple, very minimalist example to demonstrate integrating
Midtrans Snap with Flask (Python). To start:

1. Install Python (3.6.0, for instance, as used by this example)
2. Clone the repository
3. Install virtualenv then run `virtualenv venv`
4. Activate virutalenv locally: `. venv/bin/activate`
5. Install flask: `pip install Flask`
6. Install midtrans: `pip install midtrans`
7. Run `FLASK_APP=web.py flask run` to start the web server

The app will run at port 5000.
